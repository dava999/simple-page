I'm from Puebla, Mexico. I have a BCS from the Faculty of Computer Science at the Autonomous University of Puebla, and later I got a PhD in Computer Science from the Computer Science Department at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK.

Currently I'm professor at FCC and I'm part of the civil society in Puebla Vigila AC.
